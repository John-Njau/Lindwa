        <h3>Well, Valentines is here. I usually have no expectations for myself coz as you've seen<br>
            I am pretty dissapointing, but here is a piece of me...Not in flesh but in code.</h3>

        <div class="video">
            <input type="button" class="flip" value="Click me" onclick="vid1()">

                <p>My boss lady, I do not know where to start.<br> I really appreciate the 7 months we have spent together, <br>I have grown in love and loved every bit of it.<br>
                I have never felt this way towards anyone, you make my heart light up inside.<br> I know you love fighting me, haha. We both know that though.
                I will always put you first baby girl,<br> I promise to keep loving you and I will never allow anyone or anything to get between us.</p>

                <p>There's pretty much I can say about you.<br>
                     I honestly don't know where to start.
                    You're so pretty, not only on the outside but even in the inside, haha.<br>
                    I mean, you've stood with me through shit. Your kind doesn't do that.<br>
                    I know I have been dissapointing, but we always hope for a better tomorrow.<br>
                    I also know that this is not how you envisioned your first valentines while in love,<br>
                    I am sorry for underperfoming, one day, very soon I'll make it up to you my sweetheart.

                </p>

                <p>This is corny and embarassing, isn't it?<br>
                    From the day I met you, something in me shifted,<br>
                    Was it my take on relationships? Or maybe my time had just come to be in love?
                    Oops, before I forget, forgive me for being an asshole.<br>
                     I fucking love you so much babe.</p>
